# Autonomous_Serial_Manipulators_for_Insdustry
Thank you for visiting, we appreciate your time!
This repository is for a ping playing robot, we used an ABB IRB120 robot provided by our university (Ain shams university), we used Intel RealSense D435.
This is a premature version of the ABB ping-pong playing robot repository, we are still developing and updating the packages to be used easily by your side.
In this repository, you'll find two main packages, first one is the vision system for a ping-pong playing robot, which is the ball detection, tracking, and prediction.
Second package is responnsible for the robotics control in our project.
Feel free to contact us for any inquiries!
